We exist to reflect the heart of God and His love for the nations, the poor, the lost, and the forgotten. "We are not defined by the petty price tag mentalities of society.

ISRAEL HOUGHTON & NEW BREED have achieved a synthesis of music and message that is electrifying and activating audiences inside and outside of traditional church walls. Most of their albums have been recorded before live audiences to capture their infectious energy. Leader, singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Israel Houghton has seen his compositions become integral components for progressive now-generation churches. Flanked by voices filled with joy, purpose and conviction singing over galvanizing arrangements of music with African, Middle Eastern and South American slants, Israel and New Breed have swiftly amassed a legion of followers that crosses generational and cultural lines. And as barriers are blasted away, the sprawling cutting-edge unit has been fittingly graced with two Gold-selling albums, seven Dove Awards, two Stellar Awards, a Soul Train Award, seven Grammy® Award nominations, and four Grammy® Awards. The most recent being a 2011 Grammy® for Best Pop/Contemporary Gospel Album (Love God.Love People.)

Building on the theme of his Grammy-winning 2009 offering The Power of One, Houghton returned to the studio, this time London''s famed Abbey Road Studios, to record his new masterwork and another Grammy winner, Love God. Love People., with a little help from his friends. There, holed up in a hallowed space of classic recordings by Rock royalty The Beatles, Houghton and his crack team of co-producers Aaron Lindsey and Tommy Sims, along with guests Fred Hammond, Kirk Franklin, and Take 6''s Claude V. McKnight, Mark Kibble and Joey Kibble, created a new ode to love in this epic, 12-song cycle. The result, Love God. Love People. (Integrity Music/Columbia), delivers the musical versatility, profound lyrics and galvanizing displays of vocal and instrumental virtuosity fans have come to expect from Israel Houghton. 

Summing up Love God. Love People., and the culmination of his first 20 years in music ministry, Houghton states, "For this season of my life, this is what I''m still passionate about. If I wasn''t an artist, I would still be an activist - out trying to make a difference and giving a voice to those who don''t have one. New Breed could have easily found its end at any time overnight. Not because the music wasn''t good, but because we had failed up to that point to discover our real purpose. It was not to build a platform under myself but to build a platform under others. Once we as a team grasped the understanding that ''Strength is for service not status'' (Romans: 15), we knew our success was not about winning awards, selling platinum CDs or selling out concert halls. It was about taking whatever momentum we could gather and giving it back in service. That''s what has kept me and New Breed relevant, focused and effective. And I am grateful that God has surrounded me with people who have that same heart.”', N'https://mtracks.azureedge.net/public/images/artists/cover/512/1.jpg', N'https://mtracks.azureedge.net/public/images/artists/hero/2420/1.jpg')

In either event, those strategies often backfire — though in staying true to his calling, GRAMMY® winner Chris Tomlin thinks not of popularity, but rather the populace his music can touch and encourage.

“I’m not trying to make a different kind of record,” says Tomlin of his latest effort, Love Ran Red “It’s still the same path I started down: writing songs for the church, songs people can sing, songs that connect with people in their heart and move them in a way only songs can. That’s not changed — and yet this collection I feel is the strongest I’ve ever done.”

<!-- read more -->
That’s setting the bar quite high for his tenth studio recording, given that his last effort “Burning Lights” kicked off 2013 as a No. 1 album. It also led to sold-out tour dates, Billboard Music Awards, being named a BMI Songwriter of the Year and receiving the K-LOVE Fan Award for Male Vocalist of the Year and Dove Award for Songwriter of the Year.

Yet Love Ran Red picks up where its predecessor left off. True to its title, it expresses beating-heart faith and channels love’s ceaseless flow into a dozen songs to get the blood pumping and spirits soaring. To that end, Love Ran Red shows Tomlin reaching and stretching forward, even as he leans back on what’s always worked best. Produced by longtime friend and collaborator Ed Cash (Kari Jobe, Vince Gill, David Crowder* Band, Dave Barnes, Steven Curtis Chapman), the album strikes stirring tones of hope, praise and the peace found only in God’s presence.

The album’s first hit single, “Waterfall” conjures images of people dancing in the rain as Tomlin showers the listener with a call and response: “Your love is like a waterfall, waterfall/ Running wild and free/ You hear my heart when I call, when I call/ Deep calls to deep.” Then there’s “Jesus Loves Me,” the follow-up single. Kicking off with a regal, anthemic piano, the song rolls into thunderhead rhythm before hitting its thrilling, reassuring chorus: “Jesus how can it be? He loves me, he is for me.” Tomlin then declares, in a brilliant turn of phrase: “He holds the stars and holds my heart/ With healing hands that bear the scars.”It’s a very personal song for Tomlin, a songwriter not often known to go that route. “I sang it from somewhere deep inside,” he says. “You can’t outlive the presence of God, the love of God, and God will find you wherever you are. We can spend our whole lives learning all this grand theology of God. But at the end of the day it comes down to ‘Jesus loves me.’”

The track juxtaposes beautifully with “Almighty,” which also starts with solo piano but takes a different lyrical route. “It’s about the majesty of God, the holiness and beauty and complete otherness of God, where we come to worship him for who he is — this massive untouchable God—and bow as low as we can in his presence.” That majestic message collects musical momentum and might, keeping its sing-along appeal even as Tomlin celebrates God’s “sovereign crown of royalty.”

“I don’t think I can write a bigger song in my life than ‘Almighty,’” Tomlin says. “When I hear that opening melody, and that opening piano, it’s like a glimpse of heaven to me. And yet I don’t think I can write a more intimate song of grace than ‘Jesus Loves Me.’ It’s great that they’re both on this record together.” It’s also fortuitous that Tomlin included the latter track, which was written after he thought the album was done. “The funny thing is that you never know what songs will pop up,” he says. “Eleventh hour songs seem to be ones that are really special. That’s what’s so crazy and beautiful.”

The album takes its title from what Tomlin calls its “centerpiece lyric,” as heard on the song “At the Cross”: “Where your love ran red and my sin washed white/ I owe all to you, I owe all to you.” He couldn’t be more passionate about what that couplet represents, and how it describes his place in the musical landscape: “That’s the good news, what every church is trying to say to people, what the gospels point to,” he says. And with each song on this collection, Love Ran Red owes its sweeping scope to an artist seeking to enrich the worship experience. “So many of these songs are so easy for any church to do, and will also translate well to the concert setting,” Tomlin says. “Every song was really labored over and taken seriously, and so many songs were cut: There were 10 that didn’t make it.”

In fact, it took Tomlin seven months to craft, record and refine Love Ran Red, a long time dedicated to a record he hopes will last. This is, after all, the same Chris Tomlin who’s recorded modern-day worship classics such as “How Great Is Our God,” “Our God” and "Indescribable.” With 12 No. 1 radio singles, a GRAMMY® Award, eight additional nominations, three Billboard Music Awards, 21 Dove Awards, 5 gold and 2 platinum digital singles, a platinum and four gold albums to his credit, Chris Tomlin is among the most well-known and influential artists in contemporary Christian music. With 15 of the Top 100 CCLI songs, four of them being in the top ten, it’s estimated that more than 40 million men, women and children sing his songs each week, a statistic that moved TIME magazine to proclaim him “likely the most often sung artist anywhere.”

Yet for all the accolades, awards and recognition, it doesn’t get any better than the recent Sunday when he walked into a small church while working on Love Ran Red. Maybe 100 congregants were present. No one knew or recognized Tomlin, nor did he know a single soul. Then he listened with amazement and hushed humility as the church musicians performed several of his songs, including “Jesus Messiah” and “Whom Shall I Fear?” “It was a reminder that this is what I pray for, and that God gives me songs for,” he says. “It goes beyond me, or a person, or a Chris Tomlin song. To see that was encouraging to me in so many ways.” 

So too has Tomlin encouraged so many with his bold and beautiful declarations of faith. Love Ran Red certainly builds on his ongoing mission, but there’s more to it that that. It also runs deep — and points to Jesus with more energy and enthusiasm than anything he’s recorded before.

Organic, acoustic, and packed with live energy and freedom, it''s the unpolished imperfection and open invitation to sing along that has catapulted these artists into the spotlight and up the charts.

<!-- read more -->

For All Sons & Daughters'' Leslie Jordan and David Leonard, these qualities are even more keenly experienced in music that connects broken people with their God. Worship leaders at Journey Church in Franklin, TN, their critically acclaimed EPs, Brokenness Aside, Reason To Sing, and The Longing, along with their full length albums, Season One and Live bear witness to the power of worship by the people, for the people and of the people. In the truest sense, the mesmerizing, soul-baring lyrics and acoustic styling of this talented duo are beginning to make an impact...inside and outside the church.

Fragments. Change. Growth.

Releasing in May 2014, All Sons & Daughters'' self-titled studio album turns the page on a new chapter for the duo, a new season of leaning into their own musical and lyrical instincts. "We''ve allowed ourselves to be more creative, more reflective of who we are, while still writing songs for the church," Leslie says of the self-titled album. The album''s cover art-an incredible mixed-media piece created specifically for AS&D by artist Deeann Rieves-perfectly represents the fragmented beauty of growth and decay inherent in all of life. "We asked Deeann, who is familiar with our work, to listen to the new record and paint a piece that fits what you hear. What you see on the cover is really unique. We feel like we''re ''standing on the foundation of the fragments and pieces, musically speaking, building on the changes we''ve encountered over the past few years," David says. 

Produced by Paul Mabry, All Sons & Daughters features a ''wish list'' of co-writers, Stu G (of Delirious), Derek Webb, Leeland, Sandra McCracken, Jack Mooring and Francesca Battestelli. "The beauty of co-writing," David explains, " is getting some new blood in to really push us, to think differently about the lyrics." 

I would be a fool / If I could be made new /Come ruin, come ridicule
Recklessly I come, I run to You - "Your Glory and My Good"

"Your Glory & My Good," co-written with Derek Webb, sets the tone for the album. "It was challenging, but so invigorating to write, and it tells such a beautiful story," Leslie says of the song inspired by the story of the woman with a bleeding disorder in Mark 5. "The older I get, the more I experience life, the more I experience my own depravity, the more I see my need for the kind of bold faith this woman had. She was rejected by society, but she knew if she could just get to Jesus, he could heal her. We don''t see that kind of faith much in today''s society, that kind of faith is ridiculed... so I''ve been really challenged by that. Even before we started writing, we knew this song would be special." 

"You Will Remain," available for pre-sell on iTunes, originated from a melody shared by a local guitar shop owner, David Wood. The first song written for the record, its melody led Leslie and David to the Gospel of John where Jesus refers to himself as ''I AM.'' "We were struck by the truth of it," Leslie says. "He didn''t say ''I was'' or ''I will be,'' but ''I am.'' And he wasn''t overstating anything... the constant, unfailing nature of God and his goodness. We never tire of leading this one."

By the means of grace and the hope of glory /All honor and glory forever
From now to the end of the age

Inspired by a prayer of thanksgiving found in the Book of Common Prayer, the benediction that closes out each AS&D event, "We Give You Thanks," emerged with the co-writing help of Jason Ingram. "It''s just such a beautiful moment when we read that prayer as a congregation every night," David explains. "We were sitting around one night and thought ''What if we wrote a chorus around this thing?'' And it''s just been such a cool part of the night, connecting that prayer to the chorus and seeing the congregation catch on." 

More joyful and celebrative overall, the album includes two songs previously recorded live, songs that are catching on with churches nationwide now reinterpreted in studio: "Great Are You Lord" and "God With Us," both audience favorites and significant moments on their tours. In these and all the original worship compositions for this eponymous release, Leslie and David continue to pursue authenticity and honesty in the music they make.

With plans to tour with Crowder in October 2014, All Sons & Daughters take great care to make music that meets people where they are, to find the pulse of the people in the cities where they play, to serve and resource musicians and worship leaders. As always, their song charts are free online, and they continue to take advantage of any opportunity to start new conversations about what worship might look like when approached from an authentic place ...Worship as a true reflection of the heart, however fragmented, however weak, however strong.', N'https://mtracks.azureedge.net/public/images/artists/cover/512/118.jpg', N'https://mtracks.azureedge.net/public/images/artists/hero/2420/118.jpg')

From its start in 1995 Passion has been rooted in the confession of Isaiah 26:8 – “Yes Lord, walking in the way of Your truth we wait eagerly for You, for Your name and Your renown are the desire of our hearts” - existing to glorify God by uniting students in worship, prayer and justice for spiritual awakening in this generation. Passion has encountered millions of students and 18-25 year olds, young people whose lives have been transformed by the power of the Holy Spirit.

<!-- read more -->
One of the most impactful and stirring aspects of the movement, founded by Louie and Shelley Giglio, has been the sea of voices uniting together to lift up the name of Jesus, currently helmed by Kristian Stanfill, Brett Younker and Melodie Malone. The band has seen worship leaders such as Chris Tomlin, Matt Redman, Crowder, Christy Nockels and more uniting over the years, writing, recording and leading arenas in worship.

Transcending the conferences, songs from Passion have become some of the most recognizable and unforgettable worship anthems of this generation. With more than 1.9 million units sold and a multitude of chart-topping singles such as “How Great Is Our God,” “God Of This City,” “One Thing Remains,” “Even So Come,” and “10,000 Reasons (Bless the Lord),” listeners across the world continue to be impacted by the music of Passion.

Recorded live with the backdrop of three sold-out arenas, Atlanta’s Philips Arena, Infinite Energy Center and Washington D.C.’s The Anthem, Whole Heart, the newest collection of songs from Passion 2018 brought together more than 32,000 students from 700 universities and 35 countries. Passion believes worship and justice go hand in hand. Students sponsored 3,330 children through Compassion International, raised $103,623 for Voice of the Martyrs Korea, which distributes Scripture in North Korea, and brought supplies for children affected by Hurricane Harvey. The gathering of 18-25 year-olds continued to fight modern day slavery through The END IT Movement, assisting in awareness, prevention, rescue and restoration.

Whole Heart follows in the footsteps of beloved top-selling, annual Passion releases, including last year''s Worthy Of Your Name which also topped Billboard''s Top Christian Albums chart. The live recording of Whole Heart
includes “God, You’re So Good,” “All My Hope,” “More Like Jesus,” “Reckless Love” and “Almighty God.”

Through it all, Jesus continues to remain at the center.

I’ve been a youth pastor for almost 22 years and it’s still what I want to be when I grow up,” Hall says with a grin. “The songs always really start out with what we’re teaching, and for years I’ve been using Psalm 1 in showing them what a believer looks like. It says: ‘Blessed is the one who does not walk in step with the wicked or stand in the way that sinners take or sit in the company of mockers, but whose delight is in the law of the Lord, and who meditates on his law day and night. That person is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season.’”

For Hall, nature seemed to underscore scripture on a family vacation in Gatlinburg, Tenn. when he looked at the trees near the river. “Their roots are exposed and you can feel them just doing everything they can to get to where the water is,” he says. “When I talk to families about how they are doing, they always say ‘just surviving.’ That is not the life that God designed for us to live. That’s not saying that you’re not going to have problems. None of the New Testament people had it easy. They all had troubles, some even at the expense of their lives. The book of joy, Philippians, was written from prison. Hard times are going to come, but God didn’t put you here just so you could survive through hard times. He put you here to thrive, to dig in and to reach out. This record is an effort to draw a picture of what a believer, a follower of Jesus, would look like if they dug into their roots and understood God and themselves more, and then instead of trying to go be Christian for God, they just let God give them chances to be a Christian.”

Casting Crowns’ has consistently delivered songs that spur listeners to evaluate their relationship with God and with each other. “The basic idea is let God define himself through you and if you’ll do that, you’re going to thrive,” says Hall. “The first six songs on the record are all about learning who God is and who you are. The second six songs are about how that works out. How are you going to get out there and let him live his life through you?”

The album’s lead single “All You’ve Ever Wanted” has a potent message. “It’s combating that logic that we have in us that says when we fail, we need to make it right,” Hall says. “We think we need to make things right with God. We think we’ve got to make him proud again. Not only does it not work, it’s not needed. We’re fighting a battle that’s already won and that’s what this song is about.”

Hall says the hardest song for him to write on the new album was “Love You With the Truth.” “It’s a big, upbeat rockin’ song about a person realizing that they’ve been a really cruddy friend because they haven’t shared the truth with the person closest to them,” Hall explains.  “People say, ‘I want to share the gospel, but I don’t want to ruin my friendship.’ What you are really saying is I love my friendship more than I love my friend. It’s tough, but it’s truth.”

One of the most poignant songs on the album is the compelling ballad “Broken Together.” “Marriage is tough,” Hall says. “We bring a lot of fairytales to the picture when it comes to marriage.  We bring them to the altar with us [thinking]: ‘This is going to be perfect. We don’t have to be apart. We can just wake up together every morning and no one is going to have morning breath. We’re not going to have any problems.’ And then the problems hit and you don’t know where to file those into your picture. . . The idea I’m trying to say is: ‘Can you lay down who you thought I was and love the me that is? Can we take this from where we are now and realize that I can’t be that person?’ Only God is going to be able to make this work and broken people can be broken together. To me, it’s probably the most important song on the record.”

Song after song on the album deals with tough topics and frames life’s challenging moments in Biblical perspective. “House of Their Dreams” paints a portrait of a family who has achieved what the world views as success, but inside their home, they are aching with emptiness and isolation. “Just Be Held” shares an uplifting message for anyone struggling as Hall shares what our heavenly father wants his children to remember: “Your world’s not falling apart, it’s falling into place. I’m on the throne. Stop holding on and just be held.”

“Waiting on the Night to Fall” is a powerful ballad that displays the depth and range in Hall’s voice. The haunting lyric about addiction uses the metaphor of an old man lurking in the woods, biding his time, as Hall sings: “He knows you have the answers, but truth lies dusty on your shelf and the sword that you could slay him with has become an ornament and nothing else.”

“Dream for You” features Hall’s youth group singing background vocals. The song reminds us God’s dream for us is bigger than we could ever imagine. “We have this picture of who God can use,” Hall says, noting that when God spoke to Moses, he found reasons he couldn’t do what God asked. “What God had to do for Moses is He had to wipe away that picture and say, ‘I’m going to use you.’ It’s the same way with us. When God hits us with something like ‘You need to teach this small group’ or ‘you need to live on a mission field,’ we immediately look in our own backpack at our gifts and skills. If I would have lived on that, I would have never been a youth pastor. I would have never written a song. I would have never stood up in front of anybody. I don’t have any of those things in my backpack. . . God is saying, ‘There’s an X-factor here. If you would just step up, I’ll do something that will blow your mind.’”

Working again with producer Mark Miller, who signed the band to his label more than a decade ago, Casting Crowns has crafted another collection of songs that are entertaining and innovative, yet lyrically substantive. Thrive is a rich aural feast that leaves everyone with plenty of food for thought. In writing songs for Thrive, Hall enlisted some of his favorite collaborators, among them Matthew West, Matt Maher and Bernie Herms.

It’s been more than 10 years since the members of Casting Crowns heard their first single on the radio in July 2003, the same day Hall and his wife Melanie welcomed their daughter Zoe. Since then so much has happened in the lives of each member and along the way God has taught them so much. “He’s opened our eyes to our suspicion that He was way bigger than we thought He was,” Hall says with a smile. “He didn’t need Casting Crowns to come along to help His word get out. God is winning. He’s changing the world. It may look at times like things are getting darker and darker, but they are not. Everywhere you go, you can see light and light wins. It always wins.”', N'https://mtracks.azureedge.net/public/images/artists/cover/512/279.jpg', N'https://mtracks.azureedge.net/public/images/artists/hero/2420/279.jpg')

She’ll make no mention of the multiple GRAMMY®, Stellar, and Dove awards she’s garnered over the years, let alone the several gold-and platinum-certified albums she’s scored-not even those she nabbed with brother BeBe as part of the hit-making duo BeBe & CeCe Winans.

<!-- read more -->
She won’t tell you she’s graced the covers of high-profile publications such as Essence, Jet, CCM, and Today’s Christian Woman, among countless others, or that she’s made her rounds in the talk-show circuit, making appearances on The Today Show, Good Morning America, Oprah, Live with Regis & Kathie Lee, and more. And radio hits? Forget about it.

When all is said and done, CeCe’s heart lies someplace else. Thy Kingdom Come (PureSprings Gospel), her eighth solo album, is a reflection of where her heart resides: in the very inner court of the heavenly realms, where Christ Himself is enthroned.

“When you’re in the throne room, your focus is just God,” CeCe says. “Nothing’s more powerful than that. When you do other music-positive music, gospel, inspirational, whatever you want to name it-you’re teaching lessons to other people, which is still very important. But nothing is more powerful than when you’re face to face with God.”

Purified, CeCe’s chart-topping 2005 release, saw the singer entertaining her pop sensibilities, proving once again that she excels at interpreting buoyant, life-affirming songs that a wider audience could embrace. But Thy Kingdom Come is different: it finds the gospel veteran going back to what she does best, namely, lavishing honor and glory upon the King of Kings, while rallying His people to live like royal priesthood.

Not one to pick favorites, she says she loves both ends of the spectrum. But something about singing for God and His church strikes a cord in her that not even the most uplifting, stirring pop tune can.

“Singing for God and his people, It’s more home for me,” she says. “I’m most comfortable because I don’t even have to think hard. It’s something I love and I’ve been doing it for a long time. It comes from the heart. It touches the heart. I get lost in His will. I guess I have more fun shouting from the mountaintop.”

And shout she does. For all intents and purposes, Thy Kingdom Come is one of the most empowering, moving collections of songs CeCe has recorded thus far. To make sure she reached the summit, she wrote or co-wrote 8 of the 14 songs on the project and she enlisted a who’s-who of producers to help her get there, including Tommy Sims, Luther “Mano” Hanes, Percy Bady, new comer Christopher Capehart and his production partner Brannon Tunie, Cedric & Victor Caldwell, and even her own son, Alvin Love III.

Together, they crafted one of the most compelling and complete works in CeCe’s career, combining into one the best-known elements of her beloved repertoire, including the splendor of Alone in His Presence, the worshipful spirit of Alabaster Box, the celebratory nature of her self-titled effort, and the praise-and-worship class of Throne Room.

From the driving, congregational vibe of the project’s second track “Forever”, written by CeCe, one can sense she is once again in her home turf, doing what she loves for an audience that knows what she’s all about. The song is a rousing anthem for the church-a Sunday-morning praise session like only a Winans can deliver.

From there, Thy Kingdom Come ebbs and flows through a variety of styles and movements, spanning energetic urban gospel, beautifully orchestrated balladry, and joyful corporate worship. No matter where she stands in the musical spectrum, CeCe simply owns the lyric, cognizant that she’s simply preparing the listener for deeper intimacy with the Divine God.

“It’s great to sing songs that help us or that encourage us to live right, or to talk right, or to love each other-and those are all powerful messages, things that God smiles upon,” CeCe says. “But when you just talk about the power of the living God and His awesomeness and His holiness, nothing is more powerful than that. It penetrates the heart more than anything.”

Early on in the disc, CeCe seems intent on ushering saints to that place. “He counted us worthy, so let’s be worthy,” she declares triumphantly in the motivational, urban reggae-pop “Worthy”. The song sets the stage for first radio single “Waging War”, a glorious anthem that, once again, reassures believers that the battle is already won-that the victory is ours to take, Christ is our banner and we must be willing to fight.

Through “The Coast Is Clear”, a song written by CeCe’s son Alvin Love III, CeCe invites worshippers to the presence of the Almighty Himself, bidding them to enter into sacred ground. In addition songs like “Oh Holy Place” and “You’re the One”, two heartfelt, beautifully arranged displays of symphonic grandeur, punctuated by live instrumentation and emotive piano, portray CeCe’s unmistakable gift for worship.

That place, CeCe says, is her favorite place to be.

“Being on the corner, preaching to the lost, which is what Jesus came here for in the first place, is important,” she says. “But when you just sit in the sanctuary, you’re just surrounded by His presence. You just rest in the sanctuary, you’re just surrounded by His presence. You just rest and you flow there”.

“At the end of the day, if I’m sitting in church, I’m really happy, I’m really at home. When you’re outside of that, it becomes more about the call. But when you’re inside, you don’t have to be mindful of other things. You’re just alone in His presence.”', N'https://mtracks.azureedge.net/public/images/artists/cover/512/1040.jpg', N'https://mtracks.azureedge.net/public/images/artists/hero/2420/1040.jpg')

In 2016, a collection of these artists gathered together to begin writing songs in response to all they were experiencing in the church and around the city. Church of the City''s debut EP, due in early 2020, is the first recorded collection of these songs. Recorded live with their church family and led by worship leaders Chris McClarney and Jon Reddick, along with a rotating cast of worship leaders and musicians, this project marks a new chapter in the Church of the City story as its songs go out the world for the first time.

To break the unspoken rules that exist in the CCM and Gospel World! But I think more importantly to be a mega phone for a community of creatives that have been pushed to the margins of the industry of Church Music. What brings us together, and that sound that is vivaciously smacking you in the face the first time you hit play on on a Maverick track. Isn’t the sound of a community that centered around their deprivation, it’s the audacious sound of true belonging: The beautiful harmony of long lost family.
